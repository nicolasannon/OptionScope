Introducing optionScope

optionScope is an interactive options analysis tool designed to help users visualize and explore option Greeks in real time. Built with CustomTkinter and Matplotlib, optionScope provides an intuitive interface where you can adjust key parameters such as the strike price (K), volatility (σ), interest rate (r), and time to expiration (T) using dynamic sliders and input fields.

Key features include:

    Interactive Visualization: Watch how the curves for various Greeks—Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, and Rho—update dynamically as you modify parameters.

    Call/Put Toggle: Seamlessly switch between call and put options to see how the Greeks and option pricing change accordingly.

    Dynamic Axis Scaling: The right-hand axis automatically adjusts its scale to fit the data for the selected Greek, ensuring optimal visualization.

    Real-Time Tooltips: Hover over any point on the graph to view detailed values for the underlying asset price and the corresponding Greeks.

    Annotation Management: Easily clear existing annotations with a single click to keep your workspace uncluttered.

optionScope is perfect for traders, analysts, and students who want to gain deeper insights into option pricing and sensitivity analysis through a visually engaging and highly interactive experience.
